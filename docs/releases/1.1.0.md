# MarkQuote 1.1.0 Release Plan

## Overview

Version 1.1.0 packages the background clipboard improvements, richer feedback
controls, and roadmap hardening delivered since v1.0.0. The headline changes:

- Background copy enhancements with explicit clipboard permissions and fallback
  handling for protected pages.
- Always-on copy confirmation toggle surfaced in the popup and settings.
- Structured diagnostics with popup “Copy details” affordance for GitHub issue
  handoff.
- Preparatory docs and plans for the upcoming MarkQuote Hub and power-user
  stories.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Confirm `package.json` and `public/manifest.json` both read `1.1.0`.
- [ ] Ensure `main` is merged into `release/1.1.0` and no extra commits are
      pending.
- [ ] Regenerate production build: `VITE_E2E=true pnpm build`.
- [ ] Capture release notes summary (see Highlights below) for GitHub release
      and Chrome Web Store listing.

## Validation Matrix

- **Unit tests**: `pnpm test:unit`
- **E2E suite**: `pnpm test:e2e`
- **Smoke (dist build)**: Follow `docs/dev/smoke-test-plan.md` (toolbar,
  hotkey, context menu, protected page copy)
- **Diagnostics**: Verify popup “Copy details” action copies structured JSON
- **Popup toggle**: Confirm confirmation toggle defaults to on, persists across
  sessions, and syncs with options

## Release Notes Highlights

- **Clipboard reliability**: background worker handles native clipboard APIs,
  surfacing clear fallback guidance on restricted hosts.
- **Feedback controls**: popup and options share the always-on confirmation
  toggle; confirmations now include improved messaging.
- **Diagnostics export**: popup “Copy details” action captures trigger source,
  tab URL, stack, and clipboard status for rapid bug filing.
- **Documentation**: roadmap and backlog refreshed around Epics 4–6 to prepare
  for the MarkQuote Hub, history search, and accessibility improvements.

## Post-Release

- Tag `v1.1.0` and push tag to origin.
- Publish the bundle to the Chrome Web Store (`pnpm publish:chrome`) once the
  smoke test passes.
- Update project README badges (if applicable) to reflect the new version.
