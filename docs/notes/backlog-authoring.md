# Backlog Authoring Guidelines

These notes apply to every project: keep the product backlog lean and use
supporting documents for detail.

## Principles

- Record each backlog item as a short sentence.
- Mix stories, bugs, spikes, and chores in one ordered list.
- Link to the story or design document instead of duplicating context.
- Capture acceptance criteria, implementation notes, and diagrams inside the
  linked document, not the backlog entry.
- Update entries only when their status changes (added, in progress, done,
  deferred).

## Workflow

1. Add the item to the backlog list.
2. When scope grows, create or update the dedicated story document and link it.
3. Reference the backlog entry in commits, PRs, or tickets while executing.
4. Close or remove the entry once work ships (or document why it was deferred).
