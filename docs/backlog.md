# Project Backlog

Temporary holding area for new requests before they are organized into epics.

## Completed / Validated

1. Streamline hotkey permissions so the shortcut works without forcing the popup
   (guide users through granting host/site access). - shipped; keep tests green.

## Pending

- (empty) - all items have been moved to epics.

## Notes

- Feature work is tracked in `docs/epics.md` (Epics 4-6).
- When adding new requests, add them here first, then move to appropriate epic
  when planning the next release.
