# Project Backlog

Concise list of outstanding fixes and refactors, grouped by focus area.

## Completed / Validated

## Moved to Epics

The following backlog items have been promoted to Epic 4 stories:

- **Error Diagnostics Overhaul** - Now [Story 4.3](stories/4.3-structured-diagnostics.md)
- **Background Initialization Alignment** - Now [Story 4.4](stories/4.4-background-diagnostics-alignment.md)
