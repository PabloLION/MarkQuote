Findings

- High – `tests/e2e` is still empty and there is no `playwright.config.ts`; without at least one spec and a config that loads the extension, the Playwright “end-to-end suite” is effectively missing, so running Playwright will do nothing.
- High – `launch-dev-browser.js` hard-codes the extension path to `dist` but never ensures a build exists; on a clean clone `pnpm dev` will launch Chromium without the extension, so any automated e2e flow will fail until we add a pre-build (or fall back to `vite` dev assets).
- Medium – `launch-dev-browser.js` imports `spawn` but never uses it; that dead code should be dropped.
- Low – `docs/backlog.md` feels unrelated to the Playwright setup work and could be trimmed from this branch to keep the diff focused.

Open Questions

- Do we already have a plan for the initial Playwright spec (e.g., smoke test for the popup) and the config that wires in the extension ID, or should we draft those next?

Change Context
The branch chiefly adds a Playwright-powered dev launcher plus Vitest helpers for the options page. End-to-end coverage still needs actual Playwright config/specs and a reliable build step before the e2e story is complete.
