# Story 3.10 ‚Äì Clipboard Restoration Plan

## Context

- **Branch**: `feat/story-3-10-e2e-scenario-matrix`
- **Blockers**: OS clipboard remains stale for `[POPUP_COPY]`, `[CONTEXT_COPY]`,
  `[HOTKEY_FALLBACK]`, `[MULTI_FLOW]`; Playwright reports the same failures; the
  background pipeline no longer reaches the tab-side `copySelectionToClipboard`.

## Objectives

1. Restore a reliable clipboard write path for every trigger via the synchronous
   tab-side helper proven in sanity checks.
2. Prove the behaviour with unit coverage and Playwright flows (no expected
   failure flags).
3. Document the recovery so future branches know the validated paths.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ‚úÖ Background pipeline invokes the tab-side copy helper (execCommand-first)
  for all non-popup flows, with tab ID guard rails.
- ‚úÖ Unit tests cover: background write success, fallback injection success,
  fallback failure logging.
- ‚úÖ Playwright specs `[POPUP_COPY]`, `[CONTEXT_COPY]`, `[HOTKEY_FALLBACK]`,
  `[MULTI_FLOW]` pass and assert the real OS clipboard contents.
- ‚úÖ `docs/dev/test-coverage.md` and the AAA diagram note the restored fallback
  and green flows.
- ‚úÖ `pnpm exec vitest run` and
  `pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium-extension` finish cleanly.

## Atomic Commit Breakdown

- ‚è≥ Route non-popup flows through the guarded tab injection in
  `copy-pipeline`, keeping detailed logging.
- ‚è≥ Add unit coverage for background clipboard fallbacks.
- ‚è≥ Refresh Playwright helpers and specs to assert the OS clipboard, removing
  temporary flags.
- ‚è≥ Update sanity script usage docs and test coverage references.
- ‚è≥ Final verification commit capturing command transcripts and notes.

## Technical Approach

1. **Diagnose regression**
   - Use `scripts/sanity/playwright-clipboard-copy.ts` to assert that the page
     level synchronous `execCommand` still succeeds with user activation.
   - Trace `runCopyPipeline` ‚Üí clipboard handoff to confirm where the payload is
     dropped (the background currently stops after formatting).
2. **Reinstate tab copy path**
   - For non-popup flows, immediately invoke
     `chrome.scripting.executeScript(copySelectionToClipboard, ‚Ä¶)` with a
     validated tab ID and formatted text, ensuring the synchronous
     `document.execCommand("copy")` path runs under the originating user
     activation.
   - Keep `writeClipboardTextFromBackground` only as a last resort (or drop it
     entirely if it never succeeds); log when it is attempted so regressions are
     visible.
   - When scripting injection fails, surface the error via `recordError` and
     ensure diagnostics note whether activation may be missing.
3. **Testing**
   - Unit: extend `tests/unit/background/copy-pipeline.test.ts` to simulate
     success and failure permutations with mocked Chrome APIs.
   - E2E: remove `test.fail`, ensure helpers snapshot and restore the OS
     clipboard, and assert payload equality.
   - Scripts: retain the sanity runner for manual validation and document its
     invocation in `tests/e2e/README.md`.
4. **Documentation**
   - Update the tag legend in `docs/dev/test-coverage.md` to reflect green
     clipboard flows.
   - Record the fallback rationale and logging expectations for future work.

## Dependencies & Notes

- Requires Chrome with `clipboardWrite` permission granted; confirm the manifest
  continues to declare it as required.
- Playwright environment must have host clipboard tooling (`pbcopy`, `xclip`,
  or PowerShell equivalents); document prerequisites so missing tools are
  understood.
- Telemetry work is out of scope; focus on behaviour parity first (tab-side copy
  proven in sanity checks).

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Tab ID missing or invalid** ‚Üí tab injection fails silently.  
  **Mitigation**: add explicit guards, log failure, cover in unit tests.
- **Host clipboard tooling absent** ‚Üí sanity or Playwright flows throw early.  
  **Mitigation**: document requirements and handle the error with clear
  messaging.
- **Popup closes before selection capture completes** ‚Üí payload empty.  
  **Mitigation**: verify ordering in `selection.ts` and log empties for
  diagnostics.

## Exit Checklist

- üîÑ Atomic commits merged locally per breakdown.
- ‚è≥ Manual smoke: all four clipboard flows succeed.
- ‚è≥ Automated suites green with clipboard assertions visible in traces.
- ‚è≥ Documentation refreshed and linted.
- ‚è≥ Summary prepared for the PR comment before push.
