# Story 4.2 - Post-Copy Feedback UX Refresh

**Status:** Not Started
**Depends on:** Story 4.5 (Constants), Story 4.4 (Background Alignment)

## Overview

Refresh the post-copy feedback experience in the popup to provide clearer
messaging, better preview formatting, and improved handling of protected pages
where the extension cannot operate. This story ensures the popup provides
excellent feedback whether opened manually or programmatically (Story 4.1).

## Objectives

- Improve success/error messaging clarity and consistency
- Enhance preview formatting and readability
- Add guidance for protected pages (chrome://, extension pages, file://, etc.)
- Unify feedback presentation across all copy triggers
- Use constants from Story 4.5 for status labels and error codes

## Deliverables

- Updated popup messaging with clear success/error states
- Protected page detection with helpful user guidance
- Preview improvements (truncation, "show more" for long content)
- Unified feedback regardless of trigger source
- Updated E2E tests for feedback scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Success message clearly indicates copy completed with preview
- [ ] Error messages explain what went wrong with actionable suggestions
- [ ] Protected page detection shows specific guidance:
  - chrome:// pages: "Extensions cannot access browser settings pages"
  - file:// pages: "Enable 'Allow access to file URLs' in extension settings"
  - Other extensions: "Extensions cannot access other extension pages"
- [ ] Preview truncates long content with character count and "show full" option
- [ ] Consistent feedback whether triggered by popup click, hotkey, or context
      menu
- [ ] Status labels use constants from Story 4.5
- [ ] E2E tests cover success, error, and protected page scenarios

## UI Changes

### Success State

- Green border/accent
- "Copied to clipboard" message
- Markdown preview with syntax highlighting
- Character/line count for long content

### Error State

- Red border/accent
- Clear error title (e.g., "Couldn't copy selection")
- Specific error message based on error code
- Suggested action when applicable

### Protected Page State

- Warning (amber) border/accent
- "This page is protected" message
- Specific guidance based on page type
- Link to Chrome extension settings if applicable

## Technical Notes

- Reuse `ERROR_CODES` from Story 4.5 constants
- Detect protected pages via URL pattern matching
- Preview truncation at ~500 characters with expansion

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Message length:** Keep messages concise; detailed help in expandable areas
- **Protected page variety:** Test across chrome://, edge://, file://, moz://,
  about:, and extension pages
- **Trigger source detection:** Background must pass trigger info to popup state
