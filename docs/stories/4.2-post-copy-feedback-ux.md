# Story 4.2 - Post-Copy Feedback UX Refresh

**Status:** Not Started

## Overview

Refresh the post-copy feedback experience in the popup to provide clearer
messaging, better preview formatting, and improved handling of protected pages
where the extension cannot operate.

## Objectives

- Improve success/error messaging clarity
- Enhance preview formatting and readability
- Add guidance for protected pages (chrome://, extension pages, etc.)
- Unify feedback presentation across all copy triggers

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Success message clearly indicates copy completed
- [ ] Error messages explain what went wrong and suggest fixes
- [ ] Protected page detection with helpful guidance
- [ ] Preview shows truncated content with "show more" for long selections
- [ ] Consistent feedback whether triggered by popup, hotkey, or context menu

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Message length:** Keep messages concise; detailed help in expandable areas
- **Protected page variety:** Test across chrome://, edge://, file://, etc.
