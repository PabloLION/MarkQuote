# Chrome Web Store Asset Staging

Store generated marketing assets for MarkQuote here when they are ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store.

Expected files:
- `promo-small-440x280.png`
- `promo-medium-920x680.png` (optional)
- `promo-large-1400x560.png` (optional marquee)
- `screenshot-options-1280x800.png`
- `screenshot-popup-1280x800.png`

Keep source files (Figma/PSD/etc.) inside the same folder or reference their location in
`docs/dev/publish/publishing-assets.md`. Sensitive work-in-progress files can live in `.dev/publish/assets/` and be copied here once approved.
